let SHADOW_COLOR: CGFloat = 157.0 / 255.0
    // If you want to get the propers color value you have to take the value of it and you have to divide it by 255
    // Because 0.0 is black and 1.0 is white so 157.0 / 255.0 is in between 0 and 1
    // Now go back to MaterialVIew and set the color of the shadow
